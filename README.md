# Bookflix
Bookflix is a site that allows the user to search a movie, and consequently find books that match the movies searched. Its main function is finding out if there are books for certain movies, and giving the user information on the books that show up when searched. It also has a library function that allows users to save books they want to remember, so they can return to the site at any time and find the searched books that they want to look into further.

## Why It Was Made
This website was made for book lovers and movie lovers. Sometimes, when one watches a really good movie, they're not sure if it's based off a book or not. This site not only allows the user to find this out, but it also allows the user to save said book if they ever wish to look further into it. It's an easy-to-use site that's holds information unique to each user, and can be used on any device. 

## Functionality
With this website, one can search a movie title and be greeted with a corresponding movie through the use of a modal. If they mistype the title, they will be greeted with an error message, also using a modal. Once the corresponding movie appears, the user has two options: to search again, or to search books related to the movie. If they select the latter option, four books will populate the search field, with a title, an image, an author, a description, and a button that allows the user to add the book to their library. If this is selected, the book data will be saved to local storage and the book will populate on the libraryindex page. The user also has the ability to see their old searches, and to clear the page of searched books. On the libraryindex page, the user can see all their saved books. If they wish, they can also delete their saved books, in which the local storage will be cleared.
